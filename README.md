# Graphical Enigma Machine in C Sharp
An Enigma machine, written in C Sharp. 

It is designed to work with all eight rotors that were introduced for it during the war, although only three can ever be chosen at one time. 

The code is based on joacand's code: https://github.com/joacand/EnigmaMachineEmulator which greatly cut down on time required to program the machine, thank you!
